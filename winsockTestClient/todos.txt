TASKS TO DO:

Integrate clientGame properly in client main so it runs

Connect it properly with server so messages can be passed between clients

Replace enemy map generation with the map the enemy player sends (spawnShips(1)) (around line 279)
	- I'll try to make a function to convert the map array into a 100-long char array (10x10 to 100x1) so it's easier to send as a message, and then another one to convert it back
	
Add manual ship placement in the place where it asks player if they want to manually place (around line 270)
	
Replace "system("pause")" with code to wait for server to say whose turn it is. Don't want both players taking their turns at the same time...

When the client detects they've won, send a message to tell the other client they suck (after checkVictory, line 308)

Send attack info to server (there's comments in the code where this needs to happen, currently around line 315)

Receive enemy attack info and process it (currently around line 288 but maybe can be changed)
	- The function to process enemy attacks exists and should work, just needs to be given actual inputs. Use attackTarget(int, int, int), where the first two ints are co-ords, and the last is which player is shooting. 0 means this client is shooting the enemy, 1 means enemy is shooting this client.
	- Remember that sometimes this client will go first, so it should only process enemy move if the enemy actually does a move.
